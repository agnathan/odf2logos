Disclaimer
========
This project is not related to or affiliated with Logos software in any way.  I am a missionary in France working as a volunteer to help fill the need for sorely needed Bible study materials in French-speaking Europe and Africa.

Purpose
======
The purpose of this program is to have a high-quality Open Document Format to LogosXML version 3 transformer.

Note: Logos changed its XML schema with version 3 of their software

Getting Started Quick
================
1. Copy your open document file to the scripts directory.
2. Run the odf2logos script
	$ odf2logos myfile.odt

Helping the Project
==============
From the very beginning of this project the correctness of the transformation has been top priority.  Therefore, the best way contribute to this project is to begin by looking at the unit tests, implementing one, and then making its work.
If you've installed the optional Ruby components you can simply type.
	$ rake test
This will create a webpage with the output of the unit test results.  If any particular test fails, the XML input node, the XML template used to transform the node, the expected output, and the generated output are all displayed.

Demo/                    - ODF files that can be transformed to LogosXML. Each file demonstrates the 
                           transformation of the particular ODF tag to a Logos equivalent tag.
lib/schema-definitions/  - all XSD and RNG schema definitions live here
lib/xsl-unit-testing/    - unit testing framework for XSLT based off of Jeni's XSLT Testing Framework
script/                  - scripts which serve as front ends to XSLT stylesheets 
src
src/odf                   - I put all of the books that I work on in this directory
src/target                - when I run the makefiles the output from src/odf is here
test                      - when you run the unit tests HTML and XML reports are here
